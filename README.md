# Backend API For Posts App

It provides posts frontend with crud and authentication capabilities

it also stores uploaded images to cloudinary cloud service

## [Posts Frontend Repo]()

you can view it [here]()

and view front end live [here]()

## Inspiration

I have developed this app after following [course]()

then I refactored it to more modular approach and added the ability to store uploaded images to cloudinary cloud service instead of storing it in the server.
